The Road Accident Dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of accident data to help stakeholders analyze and understand accident trends. Developed using Excel, this dashboard focuses on key metrics such as total casualties, vehicle type, road type, light conditions, and road surface conditions, offering a clear view of factors contributing to road accidents.

Key components include:

Casualty Breakdown: Displays the count and percentage of fatal, serious, and slight casualties, with an overall total of casualties across all severity levels.
Casualties by Vehicle Type: Categorizes casualties by vehicle types like cars, trucks, buses, and bicycles, highlighting which types contribute most to total incidents.
Monthly Casualty Trend: Compares monthly casualty data between current and previous years, allowing year-over-year trend analysis.
Casualties by Road Type: Highlights accident distribution across road types, such as single carriageways and roundabouts.
Casualties by Road Surface and Light Condition: Visualizes accident occurrences based on road surface conditions (dry, wet) and lighting (daylight, dark), offering insights into conditions leading to accidents.
Filter Panel: Enables users to filter data by date and urban/rural areas for targeted analysis.
